#Common-Image-Preprocessing-Techniques

In This Notebook We disscuss Common Image-Preprocessing Techniques By Example In Some Images 
Such As 

1-Gray Scale of Image and Blurring of Image

2-Define Threshold Of image with more example

3-Image with RGB image channels

4-Define Edges with More Example

5-Gradient of Image (Soblex, Sobely, Laplacian)

6-Blended of image and Histogram Equalization of image

7-Felzenszwalbâ€™s Segmentation of image

8-segmented image with marking boundaries method.

9-Segmentation image by Thresholding Using skimage.filters module

10-Simple Linear Iterative Clustering of image
